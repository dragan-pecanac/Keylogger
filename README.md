# Keylogger

This Keylogger logs each stroke on the keyboard, including space, enter, letters, numbers, shift, etc. into a text document (log.txt).
Keylogger will log each word onto a new line on the .txt file as each 'space' will "create" a new line to place the word following said space.
Instead of logging what shows in the terminal 'w' pressed 'o' pressed 'r' pressed 'd' pressed 's' pressed Key.space pressed 'h' pressed 'e' pressed 'r' pressed 'e' pressed it will only show words
