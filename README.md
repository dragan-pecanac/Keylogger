# Keylogger

The first task for this Keylogger was to simply display functionality in the terminal window of VSCode by following each stroke on the keyboard, including space, enter, letters, shift, etc.
Next was to save the recorded keystrokes to a .txt file within the same folder as keylogger.py
The recorded keys are now combined to show words as opposed to the inidividual keys, as well as displaying spaces when 'space' key is pressed, making the log a lot easier to read through.

--Upcoming--
Scan through .txt log for keywords (ex. 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'satcom')
Display usage of keywords in separate .txt documents, showing # of words before and after each keyword to display context of keyword being used
